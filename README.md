# K-means-Clustering
# Algorithm on Mall_Customers dataset.
# For convenience and to represent the clusters in 2D, only last 2 columns are considered. But, we can represent clusters on any dimension.
# Here, elbow method is used inorder to determine the optimal no. of clusters. We ontained 5 as optimal no. of clusters.
# And so, taking 5 as no. of clusters, k-means algorithm is obtained on the dataset.
# Visualization of clusters along with the centroids is done in 2-D.
